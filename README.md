## Liver segmentation using MONAI and pytorch
 
MONAI is a freely available, community-supported, PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging.
Download required dataset of Healthcare images from Medical segmentation Decathlon. url: http://medicaldecathlon.com/. The project is completed in a single file Liver segmentation.ipynb with model performance plots and Test results. U-Net convolution network architecture is employed for Healthcare images. The model is trained on Medical images of 20 patients(available data with label is of 100 patients). The model can be trained over GPU via pytorch and cuda (compute platform), versions compatible with your GPUs to accelerate model training.
